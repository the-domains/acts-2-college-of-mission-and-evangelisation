Acts2CoME is about fostering a change in your life. The kind of change that only God can bring. The kind of change that helps you focus your life. The kind of change that can have a positive impact on your world. 

The College aims to form adults, young and old, to be missionary in their whole being - in their actions and words - so that by the end of the year's experience they can form others to evangelise, while continuing to pursue their professional, academic and family life.

Acts2CoME is an opportunity to experience the love of God and the empowerment of His Spirit. It's about a life changing experience of God through prayer and study. It's about becoming a disciple of Jesus, living a life that is fully alive.
