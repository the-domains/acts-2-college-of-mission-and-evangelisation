Acts

2 College of Mission & Evangelisation (Acts2CoME) is Perth's Catholic ministry training and Bible College. It is a nationally registered training organisation offering accredited courses in Christian ministry (specialising in youth ministry); active volunteering; and screen and media.

The College takes its name from the second chapter of Acts of the Apostles which tells of the outpouring of God's Spirit at Pentecost, the dynamic difference in people's lives, and their impact on the world. Its about living that life today. Our passion is to present the person of

Jesus Christ

in a manner that equips men and women to make a difference in this society, and assist in the renewal in the Church. We seek to present the Scriptures through Catholic formation which equips people committed to impacting the world with the gospel of Jesus Christ. Whether looking for bible study, a deeper understanding of our Church teachings, or practical training in ministry skills, we invite you to come to Acts2CoME to be trained and equipped for your God-given destiny. You have the potential to become a person of increased influence. Our desire is that your love and passion for Jesus Christ will be impossible to silence.

_"Christianity is not an opinion nor does it consist of empty words. Christianity is Christ! It is a Person, a Living Person! To meet Jesus, to love him and make him loved: this is the Christian vocation"._

~ Saint John Paul II
